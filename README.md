# How to run
To run playbooks first update the group_vars/all with environment specific parameters.
Then run the playbooks in the playbooks folder to deploy individual components or all
at the same time. Each components can be deployed on their own. There are playbooks to
deploy as well as remove as this will help in testing.

Following shows deploying just rabbitmq
```
ansible-playbook playbooks/install_rabbitmq.yaml
```
# To Do
* Add options to install packages from a local folder for offline environments.
* Add tests to verify components are installed/removed properly.
